# Beale-Cipher-Analyzer
A program to test texts against the three Beale Ciphers to see if they make sensible sentences. I made this more as a quick, fun exercise rather than a legitimate attempt to discover millions of dollars worth of treasure buried in the Virginia hills. I recognize that, at this point, it is extremely likely that the Beale Ciphers are a hoax. 

It was fun nonetheless!
